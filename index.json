The enzyme has increasing expression during pregnancy, and its inhibition or knockout increases embryonic/fetal lethality and/or developmental problems. Here, we present a virtual screening model for CYP1A1 inhibitors based on the orthosteric and predicted allosteric sites of the enzyme. Using 1001 reference compounds with CYP1A1 activity data, we optimized the decision thresholds of our model and classified the training compounds with 68.3% balanced accuracy (91.0% sensitivity and 45.7% specificity). We applied our final model to 11 known CYP1A1 orthosteric binders and related compounds, and found that our ranking of the known orthosteric binders generally agrees with the relative activity of CYP1A1 in metabolizing these compounds. We also applied the model to 22 new test compounds with unknown/unclear CYP1A1 inhibitory activity, and predicted 16 of them are CYP1A1 inhibitors. The CYP1A1 potency and modes of inhibition of these 22 compounds were experimentally determined. We confirmed that most predicted inhibitors, including drugs contraindicated during pregnancy (amiodarone, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate, ketoconazole, and tamoxifen) and environmental agents suspected to be endocrine disruptors (bisphenol A, diethyl and dibutyl phthalates, and zearalenone), are indeed potent inhibitors of CYP1A1. Our results suggest that virtual screening may be used as a rapid tier-one method to screen for potential CYP1A1 inhibitors, and flag them out for further experimental evaluations.","tags":null,"title":"Structure-based virtual screening of CYP1A1 inhibitors: towards rapid tier-one assessment of potential developmental toxicants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haiyan Zhou","Guorui Zhong","Jing Bai","Xiaolei Li","Wen Peng","Lei Zhang","Jing Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"229842b3516b169c54700dc4ad45fead","permalink":"https://guoruizhong.github.io/publication/zhou-development-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-21T15:48:09.614103Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhou-development-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitors were considered a very promising class of uricosuric agents for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. In vitro activity testing of these compounds has been conducted by radio-labeling uric acid for a long time. However, relatively few offer the convenience and speed of fluorescence-based assays. Herein, we report the development of a non-radioactive cell-based method for the screening of URAT1 inhibitors using the human embryonic kidney 293T cells stably expressing human URAT1, and 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-CFL) as a substrate. The URAT1-mediated transport of 6-CFL was time dependent and saturable (Km = 239.5 μM, Vmax = 6.2 pmol/well/min, respectively). Molecules known to interact with organic anion transporters, including benzbromarone, probenecid, and lesinurad, demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of 6-CFL transport by URAT1. Moreover, we screened a small subset of compounds, and identified compound 4 as a promising URAT1 inhibitor. This in vitro assay may be employed to screen for novel URAT1 inhibitors, which are effective against hyperuricemia.","tags":null,"title":"Development of a fluorescence-based assay for screening of urate transporter 1 inhibitors using 6-carboxyfluorescein","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Since the first confirmed ASF outbreak in China on 3 August 2018, 156 ASF outbreaks were detected in 32 provinces. About 1,170,000 pigs were culled in order to halt further spread. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for it and the present molecular diagnosis technologies have trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, cost and speed, and none of them cater perfectly to ASF control. Thus, a technology that overcomes the need for laboratory facilities, is relatively low cost, and rapidly and sensitively detects ASFV would be highly valuable. Here, we describe an RAA-Cas12a-based system that combines recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and CRISPR/Cas12a for ASFV detection. The fluorescence intensity readout of this system detected ASFV p72 gene levels as low as 10 aM. For on-site ASFV detection, lateral-flow strip readout was introduced for the first time in the RAA-Cas12a based system (named CORDS, Cas12a-based On-site and Rapid Detection System). We used CORDS to detect target DNA highly specifically using the lateral-flow strip readout and the assay displayed no cross-reactivity to other 13 swine viruses including classical swine fever (CSF). CORDS could identify the ASFV DNA target at femtomolar sensitivity in an hour at 37°C, and only requires an incubator. For ease of use, the reagents of CORDS were lyophilized to three tubes and remained the same sensitivity when stored at 4°C for at least 7 days. Thus, CORDS provide a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for ASFV on-site detection.

To improve the predictivity of DAs, we attempted to apply data-rebalancing ensemble learning (bagging with support vector machine (SVM)) and a novel and comprehensive Cosmetics Europe database. For predicting human hazard and three-class potency, 12 models were built for each using a training set of 96 substances and a test set of 32 substances from the database. The model that predicted hazard with the highest accuracy (90.63% for the test set and 88.54% for the training set, named hazard-DA) used SVM-bagging with combinations of all variables (V6), while the model that predicted potency with the highest accuracy (68.75% for the test set and 82.29% for the training set, named potency-DA) used SVM alone. Both DAs showed better performance than LLNA and other machine learning-based DAs, and the potency-DA provided more in-depth assessment. These findings indicate that SVM-bagging-based DAs provide enhanced predictivity for hazard assessment by further data rebalancing. Meanwhile, the effect of imbalanced data might be offset by more detailed categorization of sensitizers for potency assessment, thus SVM-based DA without bagging could provide sufficient predictivity. The improved DAs in this study could be promising tools for skin sensitization assessment without animal testing.","tags":null,"title":"Improved defined approaches for predicting skin sensitization hazard and potency in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianming Dai","Weifan Jiang","Zizheng Guo","Zhenyu Wang","Mingping Huang","Guorui Zhong","Chuxin Liang","Xuzhe Pei","Renke Dai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a4a5aaa6e12d1da2f4028e90e39dfd67","permalink":"https://guoruizhong.github.io/publication/dai-studies-2019/","publishdate":"2022-01-21T15:48:09.615212Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dai-studies-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Withaferin A (WA) is one of the major bioactive steroidal lactones with extensive pharmacological activities present in the plant Withania somnifera. The absolute oral bioavailability of WA remains unknown and human-related in vitro data are not available. Therefore, in the present study, the absolute oral bioavailability of WA in male rats and the in vitro screening of absorption factors by Q-trap and LC–MS/MS analysis were conducted to explore possible clinical properties of WA. The developed and validated analytical methods were successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic studies and in vitro measurement of WA. The oral bioavailability was determined to be 32.4 ± 4.8% based on intravenous (5 mg/kg) and oral (10 mg/kg) administrations of WA in male rats. The in vitro results showed that WA could be easily transported across Caco-2 cells and WA did not show as a substrate for P-glycoprotein. Moreover, the stability of WA was similar between male rat and human in simulated gastric fluid (stable), in intestinal microflora solution (slow decrease) and in liver microsomes (rapid depletion, with a half-life of 5.6 min). As such, the first-pass metabolism of WA was further verified by rat intestine-liver in situ perfusion, revealing that WA rapidly decreased and 27.1% remained within 1 h, while the content of three major metabolites (M1, M4, M5) identified by Q-trap increased. This perfusion result is consistent with the oral bioavailability results in vivo. The first-pass metabolism of WA might be the main barrier in achieving good oral bioavailability in male rats and it is predicted to be similar in humans. This study may hold clinical significance.","tags":null,"title":"Studies on oral bioavailability and first-pass metabolism of withaferin A in rats using LC–MS/MS and Q-TRAP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guorui Zhong","Haojian Li","Jing Bai","Shihui Pang","Changsheng He","Xinyi Du","Haijie Wang","Qixiao Zhang","Shuilin Xie","Hongli Du","Renke Dai","Lizhen Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"f4abda2eb8a35df0f8d24a4af4114218","permalink":"https://guoruizhong.github.io/publication/zhong-advancing-2018/","publishdate":"2022-01-21T15:48:09.61665Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-advancing-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Reporter cell lines are a particularly useful tool to screen for the skin sensitization potential of chemicals. Current cell models based on Keap1-Nrf2 mimic induction by conducting antioxidant response element-luciferase plasmids. However, plasmid-based reporters may ignore comprehensive aspects of induction, thus affecting the accuracy of hazard identification. Herein, we developed a novel HaCaT-based reporter system, EndoSens, whereby luciferase was specifically inserted into the cassette for heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (HMOX1, the most consistent marker induced by skin sensitizers) by CRISPR/ Cas9. Testing data from 20 coded substances showed an accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 91.7%, and specificity of 87.5%, which exceeded the OECD requirement. Among the 35 chemicals examined, predictivity was better than reported for the validated KeratinoSens™. These results indicate that the EndoSens assay could advance the predictivity of skin sensitization, thus making it a promising tool for in vitro skin sensitization testing.","tags":null,"title":"Advancing the predictivity of skin sensitization by applying a novel HMOX1 reporter system","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://guoruizhong.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
